This project is my Hadoop MapReduce application written in Java for my Cloud Computing course undertaken at UCD. 

It takes an Apache webserver log file as input, whose entries follow a particular format. It determines the number of unique hits per Hour, Day, Week, Month and displays the results in a web browser (Firefox here).
The code consists of Mapper classes, Reducer classes, a class to write HTML files with the results, and a Main class.

The application also determines the number of hits relating to certain attack signatures such as a request to access /proc/self/environ on a UNIX system.

Also present is my Pig script for unique hits Monthly case.
