This project is my Hadoop MapReduce application written in Java. Also present is my Pig script for the same task.

It takes an Apache log file as input, whose entries follow a particular format. It determines the number of unique hits per Hour, Day, Week, Month and displays the results in a web browser (Firefox here).
